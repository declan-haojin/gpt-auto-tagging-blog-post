{"prompt":"Hoover Dam & Las Vegas: Hoover Dam很震撼，但是这辈子不会再来Las Vegas了。\n## Hoover Dam\n一大早在Grand Canyon Visitor Center稍作停留，我们便驱车赶往胡佛大坝。中途我们路过了66号公路上颇有名气的kingman小镇，我也终于品尝了一番In-N-Out Burger。之前没有在加州吃过，这回也算是弥补了一个遗憾。\nHoover Dam也是Nevada和Arizona的州界限，虽然现在是夏令时导致两个州时间一致，但是这种游走在两个时区之间的感觉非常奇特。我们在Visitor Center的博物馆和放映厅转了转，了解到了这是多么之伟大的一项奇迹工程。而整个大坝，也比我想象中的要复杂和更加强大。底部甚至有铁轨来运输物资，而上半部分则有密密麻麻的电网架设在两边的崖壁之间。\n从小便在历史书里经常听到胡佛大坝的名字，尤其是在讲罗斯福新政的时候，现在也算是见证了一部分历史。同时对我来说，亲身到访课本中描述的地方感觉非常棒。\n## Las Vegas\n本来我对这座城市抱有很多的幻想，虽然明知道这里一切都是纸醉金迷，但这里的“堕落”程度真的让我大开眼界。走在Strip，各种浮夸的建筑物真的让我感觉非常不自在。我们预定的餐厅就处在一个赌场里，穿行在暗无天日的赌场里更是让我喘不过气。尤其是看到乌泱一片的人群聚集在这里赌博，我发现自己还是无法接受这种娱乐。\n当然，我们预定的餐厅Yardbird非常好吃，Chicken Waffle和Smoked Ribs非常值得一试，也算是为整个旅行画上了一个圆满的句号。（当然在这里，就不要想着有任何性价比了）\n吃完饭，我们步行返回停车场，却被告知不可以从车进入的地方走下去，而我正是从那里出来的。我充满不解却只能另寻出路。我们在赌场里绕行了20分钟，硬是没有找到停车场，最后原路返回，才发现停车场是在另一个赌场酒店。最后我们甚至差点没有赶上航班。总之，在Las Vegas短暂的几个小时让我这辈子都不愿意再来到这个地方了。于我而言，地狱也就不过如此吧，纸醉金迷，堕落不堪。\n搭乘红眼航班，我们离开了这座罪之城。这趟旅行，有太多太多值得记录，值得回忆的瞬间。我知道我没有办法将它们一一记录下来，只希望以博客的形式，能保留一个念想，让我的记忆多那么一抹色彩。未来，可期。","completion":"Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, travel"}
{"prompt":"Summary of 2019 VEX Robotics World Championship: # VEX 2019世锦赛总结\n------\n[](http:\/\/ww1.sinaimg.cn\/large\/bea775ably1g495bkhmssj22a13a44qr.jpg)\n难忘的一次经历。\n## 久别重逢\n作为刚刚转入国际班的新生，我很荣幸被韩老师选中参加VEX2019世锦赛。赛前，有激动、欣喜，也有紧张与茫然。VEX，于我而言是一个既熟悉又陌生的竞赛项目。初中时在韩老师的带领下参加了“一网打尽”和“星光璀璨”两个赛季，也收获了很多。本以为与VEX在此分道扬镳，没想到如今的久别重逢。与熟悉的金属结构件相遇、与机器人对抗电机高速旋转的齿轮声相遇，更重要的，更重要的是与初中时有着共同热爱与梦想的同学们和老师重逢。这一切都让我激动不已，就像是星星之火在无数个暴风雪夜之后重新成为熊熊烈火一样，照亮了我的心。\n当然，新的问题接踵而至。VEX推出了全新的V5主控套装，新的编程环境，这一切都是需要我去学习和尽快掌握新的知识；这里有了更多陌生的面孔，有身经百战的学姐和学长、还有已经征战将近一个赛季的国一的同学们。而我，作为一个新加入机器人社团大家庭的人，如何让大家认识我、了解我、信任我是亟待解决的问题。\n在赛前，我努力地尝试编写自动程序，当小球被精准地吸入机器人的储球仓时、当小球射中旗杆的那一刹那，那种久违的激动与喜悦再次涌上心头，每一行代码，都是自己思考过后的体现，每一次正确编译和执行，都有着小小的成就感。\n我找回了那种感觉，拾起了彼时的梦想，找寻到了志同道合的朋友们。同时也学习了新的知识，结识了新的朋友，更有了新的体悟。\n## 我们在一起\n高新一中机器人社团是一个整体，我们代表的不仅是个人，而是整个社团，整个学校甚至中国。每一个人都是这个集体的一份子，我们的行为会对整个集体产生影响。\n无论坐飞机，坐大巴，整理比赛器械，参加比赛，我们都在一起。启程的那一天晚上，杨子逸、李恺峰和其他几个学长一起在整理东西，我看见每一个人都仔细地寻找需要的零件，彼此认真核对，最后整齐地放入行李箱。我看见党一然学长一丝不苟地为机器人安装保护架，最后用防震材料小心翼翼地将机器人放入箱子里。而此时，是凌晨两点。我看到所有的人各司其职、所有的步骤稳步推进。作为新成员，我第一次感到，我们真的是一个集体。\n办理超大件行李托运的同学不用着急，因为他们知道，我们会在安检处耐心地等待他们；坐在飞机后面的同学下机不用着急，因为他们知道，我们会在国际到达最显眼的地方等着他们。我们，不会孤单，我们有彼此。我们，有共同的期许与愿望。\n## 白天当地时间，晚上北京时间\n作为社团的新成员，我本以为此次比赛我的任务只限于看场地、管理电池，一个队伍8个人是完全冗余的状态。但实际上在整个比赛过程中，有太多的事情需要去做，只要主动，总会有需要自己做的事情，并不只是老师所分配的任务。队伍中的每一个人找准自己的定位是极其重要的。\nVEX 比赛中，联队的联络是非常重要的。有时候学姐需要去练习场或者打技能赛的时候，我就主动去帮助学姐联络接下来的联队。既可以更加熟悉VEX 的比赛规则，了解整个分区的其他队伍，又可以锻炼自己的英语水平。\n当然，熬夜是逃不过的。最开始我也在抱怨，为什么搭建临时场地的是我们国一年级，熬夜摆场地帮助学长调自动程序的也是我们。学长学姐也是这样过来的，没有谁可以只去做最重要的事情。一个团队想要成功，必须有人愿意去做累的、无聊的、重复的事情。而在这个过程中，也是一种锻炼，当我知道原来还原比赛场地要一分一毫追求标准时，未来我编写自动程序时就会按照这个标准严格执行；当我熟悉了如何快速搭建场地，掌握了搭建场地的细节，我就会知道如何去更加高效容易的得分。当场地图纸深深地印在脑海里时，会简化很多原本复杂的工作。\n比赛开始的第一天，有可能是我还不适应比赛节奏，晚上回到酒店到头就睡，可以说是精疲力尽。看到国一的其他同学都帮助学长们调程序到很晚，我也很不好意思，无地自容。第二天，依旧很累。记得最清楚的是韩老师的一句话：“大家都很累，每个人都走了上万步，没有谁是不累的。只是心里有根弦紧绷着，清楚地知道自己有任务没有完成，才会一直坚持下去”。那天晚上，一直在场地帮忙摆场地。记得稍微在场地上躺了1分钟就睡着了，醒来时看见每个人还都在做自己该做的事情。场地一遍一遍地还原、代码一次又一次地修改下载、电机一遍又一遍地驱动，可正是在这个无限循环的过程中，诞生了最好的机器人，最稳定的自动程序，最强大的一只队伍。\n由于需要在比赛中切换操纵手，而使用V4定义双手柄的方法并不适用于V5，我和另一个学长何林睿开始上网查找有关V5双操的信息。但由于是新产品，整个信息资源十分有限，我也咨询了在比赛中认识的外国队伍，可是直到最后也没有找到合适的解决方案。我们只能按照主控和单手柄的定义方式尝试定义双手柄。“primary”和“partner”这两个词语，已经永远地印刻在了我的脑海里，那一句定义代码永远也不会忘记。虽然只是简简单单的一行代码，可对我而言，这是我和学长凭着自己的努力，按照规范自己想出来的。这与说明文档上已经给出的语句是不一样的。这一句，我们永远不会忘记，以后碰见类似的情况也一定会自己解决。虽然说最后双操程序出了些问题，但我还是非常开心，毕竟自己熬夜写出了基本的思路和代码。学长和老师能够信任我，给予我机会去尝试，是对我莫大的鼓励与肯定。\n同样，我也不会想到，我的自动程序会派上用场。由于两份源代码所有的电机定义都不一样，而又要同时使用两份源代码的自动和手动程序，我只好用`define`语句替换关键字。如果不是韩老师之前在编程课上提及过，如果不是自己下来查找过详细用法，我永远不会想到这样的方法。有时候，编程的小技巧却能够大大提高编程效率。而这些技巧，就是需要不断在日常的编写中与同学和老师们的交流，在网上查找的过程中来获取的。\n那天晚上，韩老师一直陪我到最后。关闭主机、拔下电池、插上充电线、关上灯，和韩老师一起离开。在那个转角处，我看见韩老师的背影，有一种难以言喻的感觉。刷房卡，按下扳手，室友早已熟睡。看看表，已是凌晨五点，洗个澡，静静地看着太阳从远处升起，又是疲惫而又充实的一天。\n## 榜样\n我很敬佩社团里的每一个人，他们让这个社团成为了一个真正的社团。\n韩老师，最值得我敬佩的人。带着热爱与希望，度过了每一个夜晚，还有更多我们不知道的困难。再多的话语都显得苍白无力，老师您辛苦了！这是我内心最真实的流露。\n学姐，作为老社长，每一次人员的集合、解散，房间的分配都是学姐负责。整个社团在她的安排下总是井井有条。住到新酒店之后，还没有等我们找到自己的房间，学姐就把所有人的房间号全部记录好并发送到微信群里了。很简单的工作，却是最重要，最容易忽视的工作。记得学姐每天早上的人工叫醒，当我迷迷糊糊地接电话时，学姐早已经起床洗漱完毕，提醒其他人起床了。\n杨子逸和李恺峰学长，两个人形影不离，经常被我们拍到靠在一起呼呼大睡的照片。但是两个人确实最有默契的，666U整个队伍在两位学长的带领下一路披荆斩棘，闯入复赛。杨子逸学长调程序时，李恺峰学长在旁边提出自己的建议，李恺峰学长练习操纵时，杨子逸学长也会很中肯地提出建议。我认为这是最好的学习方式，相互学习，共同进步。虚心接受他人的建议，敢于去站在整个团队的立场上向别人提出建议都不是容易的事情，但两位学长都做到了，而且做的很好、很成功。\n樊金同学，作为国一唯一一个女生，却为团队贡献了很多。赛前的工程日志，我看见每次社团课和晚自习的空余时间，都是她一个人一丝不苟地画图、写字、排版。虽然没有能够取得全能奖，但这份70多页沉甸甸的工程日志值得我们每一个人细细翻阅，它饱含着樊金同学对于整个团队的认真付出。在比赛的过程中，樊金同学清晰明了的对战分析和情报收集也是我需要学习的。每一场比赛，对手队友，时间地点，以及队友对手的各个比赛场次她都全面地一一罗列。一个人静静地坐在看台上录下每一场队友对手的比赛，并仔细分析。\n不止他们，社团里的每一个人都值得我学习，每一个人都有自己的艰辛，每一个人都为整个团队付出了许多，我们每一个人让社团不断向前进步。\n## 真正的意义\n还没有来到比赛场地，没有走进Freedom Hall的时候，我一直都在思考，自己此行的目的究竟是什么。最开始，我认为要竭尽自己所能，帮助团队取得最好的成绩。可当推着箱子走进灯光璀璨的比赛场地时，当站在凳子上将国旗高高悬挂在队伍的展板上时，当对面的陌生人主动向我问好时，VEX 比赛成绩对我来说已经不重要了，重要的是在这个世界性的舞台上展示自己，展示中国。大胆地、勇敢地去和来自全世界各地的、不同文化、不同信仰、不同价值观的同龄人交流、学习、共同进步。比赛只是一个很好的形式，技术的切磋必定伴随着广泛的交流。\n第一天，也不知绕着整个场地转了多少圈，满怀着激动的心情。我看见身着奇装异服的队伍、我看见糖果铺满的队伍……机器人对于他们来说只是这次比赛的一个方面，他们创新新奇的思维不止体现在机器人的构建上，而是方方面面。这种开放和发散思维是我需要学习的，用于向他人展示自己、展示自己价值观所认同的东西。\n这一次比赛，是我用英语交流最多的一次。哪怕把“autonomous”这个单词一直读错发音，依然不影响我们的交流，敢于开口，敢于交流是我学到的最重要的东西。\n我认识了德克萨斯州热情的Dover, 我们谈论了很多中美的差异问题，简单的问题却联系起了两个异国人；我认识了来自阿联酋的小胖，宗教从来不是阻碍我们交流的原因；我认识了纽约州两个初中男孩和他们的父亲，兄弟两人在爸爸的教导下已经参加VEX比赛3年了；我认识了来自英国伦敦的一群可爱的朋友，甚至询问他们关于脱欧“Brexit”的看法；更加幸运的是，我认识了来自华盛顿州西雅图的Emrecs, 他的父亲在微软总部从事Onenote的开发工作。我们坐在看台上聊了很久，我从未想过能遇到与自己一样热爱微软的他。这真的是一次极其难得的机会，我能够认识来自全世界各地的同龄人，用着同一种语言，表达自己的思想。交流，真的是一件很美妙的事情。\n现在的我，更加热爱VEX机器人竞赛，它对我而言有了更加深刻的意义。\n坐在飞往北京的客机上，下方是白茫茫一片的北极。心中真的有一种淡淡的忧伤，不舍得这里的每一个人，每一个不眠的夜晚，每一场精彩绝伦的机器人对抗。\n之前每一次出国，都是夏令营、冬令营活动。一群素不相识的陌生人从相识到相知，却难免要分开，只能将美好的回忆珍藏在心底。而这一次，同样是与并不熟悉的同学们相识相知，我们却可以继续一同努力，延续这一份难得的友谊，在下一个赛季携手再创辉煌。这是令我最为激动的事情，各位，一起加油！","completion":"robotics, VEX, travel"}
{"prompt":"One third passed: This semester has been surprisingly long, in a positive sense.\nThis might be the first time I could sit down and begin typing my blog post during a Monday night. I just finished running 10km on a treadmill and am feeling really good right now to write something down.\nThe semester has been quite long for me. Last semester passed in a blink of the eye while this semester I have experienced so much. By experiencing, I mean mostly emotionally and things happened in my head. For example, I have more responsibilities. Every week I am thinking about how to make sure APO brothers show up to the weekly service events I coordinated. It has proven that my bugging all the time works very well and a decent number of people showed up every time. The moment where more-than-expected people showed up to my events, I felt a strong sense of achievement and mostly happiness. This has been my source of motivations to fulfil my Service VP responsibilities. Apart from that, I was trying to date a girl which didn't end up very well but costs tremendous mental energy. However, I finally have been through the experience once. It was great to get to partially to know a girl and get a better understanding of love. The ordeal has provided clarity to me, and even the most unremarkable and implausible romance plots in movies now appear plausible and sensible.\n## Classes\nI very much enjoyed all the classes I am taking, of course except the discrete math class. My favorable class would definitely be Marxism and Society, which I decided to take out of purely curiosity. The professor was extremely good at explaining Marx's pieces and all the esoteric concepts. To be honest, I didn't really do the readings but every time he breaks down everything in such an organic and logical way. Mostly importantly, I got a full score on the first midterm! I know it was not a hard core midterm but I at least prove to myself that I am capable of learning something not cs. Reflecting upon the class, I realize I enjoy absorbing all the unique views and ideology proposed by Marx. Whether feasible or not, it is intriguing to get to know his theories. Admittedly, my classmates are way more smarter and insightful than me. Sometimes I could not even understand their speaking in the class. But overall it's great to simply be with them and be exposed to a distinctive academic environment.\nSimilarly, my Intro to Political Philosophy class provides another whole different perspective which ironically Marx refutes about. Reading pieces from Plato, Socrates, Hobbes, Machiavelli was such a fun journey, even though it was painful when composing an academically sound paper to submit. I particularly like Machiavelli's views and his book The Prince. Most things he stated is so true given the current political dynamics of the world.\nEarth and Ocean Science is not bad at all. The professor is really passionate about his teaching and makes the lecture very engaging. I guess my satisfaction of this class definitely partially comes from my obsession with hiking.\n## Summer plan\nInitially, it was challenging for me to come to terms with the possibility of not securing a genuine internship for the summer. However, after speaking with several friends, including those who have landed fantastic internships and those who have not, I began to feel a sense of relief about the situation. For now, I am planning to go to Berlin for a study abroad program and then come back to campus for a full-time software engineer job in a lab. However, I am still not sure if I could do both because of the time constraints. If this works out, I might even be able to go to an F1 race in Austria after my Berlin program!\n## Updates on my website\nIn addition to creating a night-mode option for my blog website and adding more content to haojin.li, I have achieved a long-standing goal by finally purchasing the domain lihaojin.com after waiting for three years. Plus, I have configured the GitHub actions to automatically build and deploy both my blog and haojin.li to my servers located in both China and the United States. Despite how it may sound, I am genuinely thrilled to have made these improvements.","completion":"school, classes, website"}
{"prompt":"New York City - Day3: 出人意料，这是我第一次觉得旅游的时光过的好慢，每天都游历了无数，结识了无数，感悟了无数。今天是第三天，也是想对来说较平淡的一天，却也是有额外的小确幸。\n## 酒后\n继续喝醉的故事，奇怪的是，喝醉之后我一晚上没有睡着，或者说我潜意识认为自己没有睡着。早上六七点就完全醒了，再也睡不着了。想起昨晚的荒唐事，真的和hang over的剧情如出一辙，忍不住傻笑起来。一个朋友光着上身，头埋在垃圾桶里吐了一晚上然后睡着了；另一个朋友躺在浴缸里睡着了，之后迷迷糊糊地趴在地上睡着了。早上起来找不到证件，果真在浴缸里。荒唐荒唐，难得难得，开心开心。早上收拾一片狼藉的房间，好奇闻了一下昨晚喝的酒，呕吐感瞬间就来了。酒真的不好喝，酒醉后说的胡话，经历确实让人上瘾。\n## 圣帕特里克大教堂\n接着睡，又是迷迷糊糊地睡到了中午12点。吃了饭，下午开始自己探索纽约。说实话，这是我人生第一次自己探索一个城市，我甚至没有一个人探索过自己的家乡。我自认为是一个非常害怕孤独的人，但大学教给我的最重要的一件事情之一就是接纳孤独，学会孤独。同理，独行旅行也是别样的感觉。整理好行装，我坐上地铁，前往圣帕特里克大教堂。自己六年前潦潦草草经过过这里，但我甚至记不清是否进去过。街角处，偌大的教堂瞬现，比记忆中的，想象中的雄伟壮观。不远处有一个车队，声浪巨大，车队悬挂着不知道是代表着什么的旗帜，我努力扭过头想一探究竟，可距离仍不足以让我分辨清楚。只记得这又一次应证了纽约的疯狂，任何人任何事，在这里都有可能。\n进入教堂，没有整个外观带给我得震撼，却也是我见过的最大的教堂了。正好赶上应该是唱诗班在合唱，非常多的人站在座位前，非常虔诚地在听。我绕着教堂走了一圈，两边的类似浮雕一样的地方都仔仔细细地逛了一遍。中途我也走到座位前，尝试用心去聆听唱诗班，去感受如此神圣化，虔诚的这样一个时刻。唱诗班结束之后，我正好走到了最前排，发现很多人是跪在专门的枕木上，虔诚无比。还有的人像是跋涉千里特地而来，与应该是教堂的人员握手交谈，我又一次感受到了他们由心而发的那种虔诚。\n往回转圈的时候，我才注意到可以两美元点亮神前的蜡烛，就像去寺庙烧香一样。我便捐了两美元，尝试去点燃一个蜡烛。这才发现所有蜡烛都是点燃了的，需要自己从左手的桶里取新的蜡烛。于是，我取出新的蜡烛，放到格子上，拿起木条去引火。结果蜡烛的引火线太歪了，我第一次没有成功。我扯了扯线，又试了一遍，终于点亮了。我在想为什么自己要去点亮，可能是想到了makenew的朋友们，虽然我目前不相信god，但我相信这群难得的朋友，我愿意为他们去点亮。我甚至没有想去祈祷什么，去忏悔什么，甚至可以说是下意识地就点亮了。当然我也知道自己不够虔诚，这或许就是第一次没有点亮成功的原因吧。但还是很开心，毕竟是人生第一次在教堂里点亮了一些东西，人生中有一些情感和人事物是和教堂有联系的。\n<div class=\"justified-gallery\">\n<\/div>\n## LEGO NYC\n乐高就在大教堂的对面，排队整整延伸了100多米。等了快20分钟，终于进来了。第一个引入眼帘的就是乐高打字机，某一瞬间我甚至说服自己需要买一个，299美元也不算是很贵，当然最后理性还是战胜了瞬间的冲动。上了楼，发现了一个好玩的东西，可以自己设计乐高小人，只是付款的时候才知道三个乐高小人36美金，真的就是黄金做的乐高小人。设计的过程还算是有趣，我购买了三个，分别送给三个朋友。有一些设计我是真的用心了，当然我也对于自己的艺术水平有理性的认知，只是希望他们喜欢，这个黄金乐高小人。\n之后无意间瞥见了一个跑车积木，看了看价格，能接受，甚至没有任何犹豫就拿起来去结账了。自己此前问了店员，我本是想去买和F1有关的跑车积木的，但店员把我领到了一楼让我看了看数百刀的布加迪和兰博基尼，我就知道这里没有F1了。当然，最后能够抱着一个跑车和三个小人离开，也算是很开心了。\n<div class=\"justified-gallery\">\n<\/div>\n## Shopping\n之后去了Nike和Adidas，因为感恩节，分别打85折和6折，所有商品。在Nike我买了一双鞋，在Adidas买了一件羽绒服还有几条裤子。说实话，这是我第一次给自己正式地买衣服，平常都是母亲给我买好了一切的一切，而我自己对于衣服鞋子也没有任何要求和我至今仍无法理解的追求潮流的思想。就算去旅行，我也只是懒得试穿，买几件短袖了事。这是我第一回，真真正正试了好久鞋和衣服，连店员都不耐烦了，开玩笑说\"Hope to see you tomorrow bro\"。但我是非常开心的，这真的是自己照顾自己的开始，自爱的开始。我开始不会将就鞋大了一点，而是找店员一个尺码一个尺码地换与试穿。我喜欢这样的自己，我开始照顾自己了。\n回去的路上，第五大道热闹非凡，百老汇的墙面上正上演着美轮美奂的灯光秀，无数的观众驻足欣赏，这种热热闹闹的感觉，很温暖。当然，又路过了微软。\n<div class=\"justified-gallery\">\n<\/div>\n## 晚饭\n回到家，朋友煮了螺蛳粉。又是一个第一次，人生第一次吃螺蛳粉。很臭，很好吃。吃完饭，感觉到了久违的空虚。今晚，没有朋友喝酒聚会，没有在第五大道夜游，我开始有点想念在durham的乡村生活，至少每个晚上我有室友，有舍友，有makenew的朋友们，有community。\n今晚确实无聊，祝好。","completion":"travel, NYC, shopping"}
{"prompt":"Toronto, Niagara Falls, and Cancun!: Well yes I flew all the way from the far north to the far south...\n## Toronto to be continued\nToronto is my friend's base and we started our road trip from here while I didn't have enough time to fully explore the city before the road trip. Therefore, after coming back from Montreal and Ottawa, I spent almost a week wandering in the city. I basically visited all the must-go places here in Toronto.\nWe bought a ferry ticket to one of the island in the Lake Ontario to get the best view of the city skyline. It was freezing cold as expected but the view was amazing. We even stayed for more than two hours waiting for the night view of this charming city.\nAfter that, of course I need to go up to the CN tower to see the night view from another perspective. I've been once here when I was a elementary school kid coming here for a math competition during Summer 2015. That time was daytime while this time I am able to do it at night. As the highest observatory in North America, it is simply stunning. However, it's definitely not worth it to purchase the extra pricy ticket to the Skypod which is 100m higher than the main observatory because you pretty much see the exact same view even given a huge elevation gain.\n## Niagara Falls\nWe also drove to Niagara Falls and stayed there for a night. I've also been here the last time during the summer and the same got the chance to appreciate the mighty nature once more from a whole new perspective of winter.\nDuring the night, there were spotlight for the falls and it was astonishing. Even though we were expecting the entire falls to be frozen, it wasn't due to a unexpectedly above freezing point temperature. That being said, it was still amazing to see the spotlight combined with the living falls. It was also great as the spotlight changed its color in a dynamic way.\nThe daytime Niagara Falls is not as pretty as night's but still worth visiting. I even found the position to make a time travel photos.\n## Why did I decide also to go to Mexico?\nIt was not on my radar in the very beginning. However, the friend I planed to visit in Toronto proposed the idea and magically he sorted everything out back in early October. Why not then? I thought it would be really cool to experience both the far north and south, the hottest and the coldest within one winter break so I just did it.\n## XCARET\nThe Cancun trip was simple to tell as it was simply amazing and I had my best hotel and park experience at XCARET. I would've bought the autobiography book XUEÑOS by XCARET founder Miguel Quintana Pali if I knew how to read Spanish. I was shocked by how beautiful, naturally preserved, friendly all the parks are.\nThat being said, I felt really guilty enjoying all these overly luxury experience. I felt thankful to the friend who made all these happen and brought this wonderful experience but in the meantime myself would definitely choose more economical way to enjoy the vacation here as I do not believe myself deserve this kind of services and material comforts. I would definitely come back with the family or friends I love but with a more reasonable lodging environment. The Luxury is once-in-a-lifetime and is already enough for me.\nAnd that's my winter break. Now it's time to start a new journey with God's Grace...","completion":"Toronto, Niagara Falls, Cancun"}

{"prompt":"A short trip to Beijing: This month is really a busy month. Writing essays for application, preparing for TOEFL, learning school courses and participating in Yau Science Awards really stressed me a lot. I feel like I have never been busy as much as now. It's not only about my academic works, since I need to consider many other things that are simple but costs tons of time. All things combined,it's a challenge for me and I need to and have to admit it.\n# Coming to Beijing\nAfter a week long prepare with my mentor, reviewing my paper and debugging my neural network model, I came to Beijing for semifinal of Yau Science Award(Computer) yesterday. Though I've been to many places without my parents, I was accompanied with teachers or schoolmates. This trip is truly the first trip that I went alone. To be honest, I even was a little nervous at first.\nEverything went OK the first day. Arriving by bullet train, I took 3 subway lines to go to my hotel next to Tsinghua University. The hotel is fine but I booked a room without windows for cheaper price. However, it was really a awful experience that I felt unwell staying at the room. (I swear I would never book a room without room again) So I decided to go to the university for checking the route in advance just in case that I might get lost the next day.\nTo be honest, I don't have a good impression of Beijing based on previous visits. No exception, it's the same this time. I don't know if it's a prejudice or something else. Anyway, I don't like this city. It imposes bad feeling to me.\n# The competition\n<div class=\"justified-gallery\">\n<\/div>\nThis competition requires me to do a presentation about my research paper and answer questions proposed by the professors lively. Before enter the room, I went through the code check first. It was in smooth going. But I got nervous suddenly when I got out of that checking room. During waiting for my turn, I met a man who's the mentor of another contester. He graduated from Princeton University and I was really shocked.\nYeah it came to my turn. There are about less than 10 professors and judges in the room. I began my presentation quickly. It went OK. Then it came to the section of questioning. To my surprise, they didn't ask me some extremely difficult technical and detailed questions as I thought, but firstly put a doubt on my research topic. Then we discussed some questions that I thought didn't important. The last question was how many lines I wrote for my algorithm.\nThere was nothing else. No banner, no picturing. I just left quickly.\n# Microsoft\n<div class=\"justified-gallery\">\n<\/div>\nI never thought I would go the chance to Microsoft at Beijing. But I did! Tsinghua University is only 2.2 km away from ZOL. I went to the Microsoft Tower 1 first and the security man didn't allow me to get in. I met a friendly stuff at the entrance and he suggested me to go the Tower 2 to see if I can get in. But the same thing happening in that place. I was unable to come in. However, this security man was so nice and allow me to stay and wait for people who have the authority to take me to upper floors. I waited and waited. I found a young man coming in to the building and began a conversation with him. I learned that he was a intern at Microsoft. He thought Microsoft working style is very different from other domestic companies like BAT. This made me more excited about Microsoft.\nFinally, a old man Mr. Pan was willing to take me in. I was so THRILLED. He worked at 10th floor where was the Microsoft Internet Research. I found the birthplace of Microsoft Xiaobing! It was quite a interesting tradition(I think?) that they mark and keep a place for Xiaobing.\nThe wall on the building are writable, which is the same as the Seattle HQ. And so many smart detection and interaction there. Anyway, the working environment is really great!\n---\nThis trip is kind of making me closer to my dream. Now, I am proud to say I am a person visiting both HQs in China and US! It means a lot to me!\nAccidental trip to Microsoft is actually my biggest gains visiting Beijing.

{"prompt":"Toronto-Montreal-Ottawa Road Trip: So here I am in Canada.\nI always wanted to come back to Canada again after my miserable last visit that I lost all my checked-in luggage due to a mistake at the layover. However, it didn't stop me from experiencing and appreciating this beautiful country.\nI decided to go there during the winter break mainly because one of my old friend who is in University of Toronto now invited me during the summer. It took a bit efforts for me to get the visa but everything sorted out quickly after that thanks to the help of my friend.\nI know it is not the best time to visit this country as it is freezing cold but I still wanted to go simply for curiosity. At least, there will be much fewer visitors everywhere I go.\n## Toronto\nI only spent a day in Toronto, catching up with high school friends mainly. I was really excited to see how they have changed since the last time I saw them was almost 2 years ago. It turned out we never changed. The moment I met them, I felt like going back time to high school, when we dedicated hundreds of hours in VEX robotics together, complaining, debating, practicing, team-working. I would say that is certainly the highlight of my high school life, even plus my middle school time.\nOne of the friend, who I never thought we could be friend, became really close friend with me, at least by my definition. We are just like the people in completely two different world, yet we get along really well. With this reunion, I enjoyed talking to him very much with nonsense jokes and gossips about our high school.\nIt was a bit sad when I realized there is not a certain next time about when we will meet again. However I do know we care about each other and wish each other the best of the best. 君子之交淡如水。\nThe only agenda for the visitor part is the Royal Ontario Museum, which I personally don't really like. There is definitely historical significant exhibits inside but they were really fragmented and scattered in my opinion. Therefore for museum rookie like me, I cannot grasp the full beauty and significance of the museum. After all, it is a decent visit while hanging out with friends a bit.\n## Montreal\nI knew nothing about Montreal. I learned from my friend that the entire province of Quebec is speaking French and all the road signs are only in French. I literally became illiteracy over there but didn't prevent me from experiencing the culture and the city.\nIt is one of the best cities I've ever visited. The downtown area is full of the vibe of arts and the french romantics. It was having snowstorm when we arrived which I never saw before. A terrible weather for others surprisingly became a first-time experience for me. I very much enjoyed the snow during the first day. Sliding and playing snow on the street was so much fun for me just like a kid.\n### Food\nThe food is amazing here. We had some great Spanish, French and Chinese food here. Besides Chinese food, the other two exotic cuisine were far better than my expectations. Indeed they look really fancy, but they tasted really well and you can actually get enough to eat at a reasonable price.\nSome of the restaurants also have great vibes with dimmed light and special seat layouts. Frankly, I am never a foodie especially during the trip as I care more about the cultures and the places we go. However, I do have a great impression on the food culture here.\n### F1 Circuit Gilles Villeneuve!\nI've always been a huge fan of Formula One and here we go! This is the first circuit I've been to and it was amazing even at a temperature of -16 degree. I felt extremely excited when walking through the starting grids and the pit lane where I saw on the TV every time with awesome formula one cars passing by.\n### Biodôme\n### Notre-Dame Basilica of Montréal\n### Old Port\n### Mount Royal\n## Ottawa\nIt is also a charming capital with less crowds compared to Toronto and Montreal. We spent a day and a night here with a long walk around the downtown area.\n### Parliament\n### Rideau Canal Ottawa locks","completion":"canada, winter, travel"}
{"prompt":"My first VEX tournament of the season: > Now I am on the bullet train from Xi’an to Baoding, crossing one tunnel after another, passing one bridge after another. Just a few minutes ago, I was sleeping deeply, but now I think I am conscious.\n## Sleepless night\n------\nFrom the beginning of the summer vacation, I was studying TOEFL everyday following a regular routine – getting up at 7AM, doing TOEFL practice all the day and then going to bed at 11PM.\nHowever, Last night even didn’t close my eyes for a while because of the unfinished autonomous program. It’s a hard and harsh work putting tons of parameters and variables to my mind simultaneously. Fortunately, with my team members Tony and Jessica helping me reset the match field quickly and accurately, finally I got it. Never forget the colorful cubes leaps on the match field which seem to lose control.\n## Nervous time\n------\nTo be honest, I didn’t put too many efforts in the VEX competition these summer vacation. I just came to participate in training two days before our setting off. I am really awkward to my excellent team member and coach Mr. Han.\nThe robot that will be used in the competition hadn’t been finished two days before. Our manipulator Tony hadn’t practice controlling the robot like catching the cube and pile them up in the specific area which is not easy and definitely needs time to be familiar with the way of controlling.\nLuckily, we had done everything in time under the unity of our team which is the most valuable and precious thing I got from the robot club. I saw everyone mounting screw carefully, writing engineer log amazingly… There exists many good personalities and characters that I need to learn from them.\n## Maybe I don’t have time to write again during the competition\n------\nI know that from now on every day and night is crucial and significant. Many unpredictable challenges and chances are waiting for us in the close future. What I can do is modifying and improving the stability and effectiveness of my program giving the mental encouragement. Perhaps every night will become sleepless just like last night, but I will try my best to fight for the best ranking in the competition.\nAlso, I would like to make more friends from all over the world with the same passion and love for the VEX.\n## Hope\n------\nHope we won’t regret this time no matter what score we will get and challenges we will faces.\n**FIGHTING!**","completion":"night, competition, robotics"}
{"prompt":"New semester: 新学期开始了。\n很久没有尝试用中文再去记录一些东西，明显得感觉到自己的写作功底下降了不止一些。有时候甚至会忘记一些中文字的写法，想起来着实惭愧。\n不同于高中，我反而很期待大学的每次开学，无论假期有多么的无忧无虑，开学总是我向往的。一是因为能够再见到朋友们，叙叙旧。开学几天和朋友们寒暄总是最有趣的，因为每个人的假期都十分不同，有去旅游的，回家的，甚至还有待在学校做实验的，无论如何我都能感慨万千。二是可以在全新的课程里认识一群新的朋友，新的教授。尤其是这学期的选课，作为计算机专业，我选了两门政治科学，一门计算机和一门用来满足毕业需要的地质学课。我最期待的就是两门政治科学：马克思主义和社会还有政治哲学入门。上学期中国包括世界范围发生的运动彻底改变了我对世界，对政治，对自己的理解，我认为这两门课能够让我更加保持清醒，保持“痛苦”。如果能够坚持得下来，甚至可以兼修政治科学。\n自己身边的朋友，大多数都是计算机或者理科专业，和他们聊天和交流是一种感觉。走进政治课堂，认识新的朋友，和他们沟通交流又是截然不同的一种氛围。并不是说孰好孰坏，但明显两类人是以不同的视角了解这个世界，而我很珍惜这样的机会，让自己能够多方面地汲取知识，了解这个世界。\n开学三周了，至少到现在，比上学期自律了很多。很少出现一个午觉睡过了整个下午的情况，反而因为恰当的课程时间安排，我最懒惰的时间总是正好是上课时间，正好抵消了我自己的惰性。同时，这学期的课程基本都需要签到，对我而言起到了非常积极的作用。同时，我才发现每门课凑巧都有自己认识的朋友，互相促进总是好的。\n除了课业之外，我还在想办法找夏天的实习机会。说实话，处在放弃的边缘。或许是因为经济大环境不好，抑或是自己还不够努力，到现在为止的结果却是无法令人满意。我在考虑学校的柏林留学项目，或者待在学校再实习一年，总之不会回国。我觉得父母说的有道理，趁着年轻有机会，多出去走走看看，哪怕旅游也比呆在家里有意义得多。\n当然，这学期成为了fraternity的service vp，自己也很开心能够成为exec的一员。协调沟通所有的volunteer活动却是很繁琐，但当我看到很多成员都来参加活动的时候，那种成就感是难以言喻的。帮助别人确实能够给自己带来极大的快乐和幸福感。\n最近还有些为情所困，但也正因这个契机，让我更看清楚了自己在一段亲密关系里是一个什么样的角色，我想成为什么样的角色，我期望对方是什么样的角色。同时，自己也确实意识到寻求帮助的重要性，当局者迷，旁观者清让我深有体会。很多朋友对于此事给予了我很多帮助，也让我意识到自己在这个方面还是一个连蹒跚学步都算不上的婴儿，需要多经历，不怕失败。无论结果如何，对我而言都学到了很多，我也相信这是一种启示，让我至少尝试去和别人建立更深的关系。\n对于这个学期，没有过多的展望，只想活好每一天，就像之前的每一天一样，不虚度光阴，即为幸福。\n祝好。","completion":"Duke Gardens, Chinese New Year, school"}
{"prompt":"New York City - Day5: 最最最后一天了，现在正坐在从纽约飞往durham的飞机上，刚刚飞过繁华的曼哈顿上空，我甚至能够清楚地看到布鲁克林大桥、自由女神像。是时候做个总结了。\n## 今天\n今天是什么都没有干，昨晚参观完911纪念馆，一晚上都沉迷于知乎的各种911专栏，意外刷到了烧焦的尸体的照片，我确实被吓到了，直到凌晨四点多我才睡着。早上起来后，整理好行李，买的各种衣服打包好到就近的快递站投递了，30刀，确实比我想象中的贵。之后到中国超市买了一大堆零食，送给朋友。\n## 朋友\n能够来纽约，多亏了我的朋友。当时我也没多想，微信里他回“来！”，我就立马订了机票，果断决策。来这里之后，也为他添了不少麻烦，蹭吃蹭住加陪玩，我着实是有些不好意思。我最大的感受是他活得很真实，令人羡慕的那种真实，对自己感受的真实对待，对自己目标的认真对待，还有对朋友的真心真实对待，我深有感触。\n他带我逛了大都会艺术博物馆，帝国大厦……这些震撼的景色，事物我可能一辈子都不会忘记，甚至我承诺还会再来一遍。我也会记住，第一次开眼界是在他的带领下。他攒了局，让我认识了新老朋友，喝酒吃烤肉，是我最快乐的时光。他的前途一路光明，我衷心祝福。\n很多话，尽在不言中。我会一直记得酒后说的那些话，我们觥筹交错之间的你来我往的对话，十年后就是我们站在曼哈顿至高点的谈资。\n今晚在纽约的最后一顿是麻辣烫，我甚至在国内都没有怎么吃过。但这顿饭确实好吃，回到学校后再也不可能吃到如此美味的传统中餐了。之后我们一起坐地铁回家，我终于碰上了地铁车厢里的卖唱，说实话还是蛮好听的。只是我还未来得及拿出钱包，他就下车了。\n到家之后，拿好行李，他送我去地铁站。等了快15分钟，M列车来了两趟，却始终没有我要乘坐的E。也许上帝也知道我还想多探索探索纽约吧。朋友站在我旁边，我一直在想当列车驶来，我们会以怎样的形式告别，是拥抱还是握手还是口头再见。我们的15分钟，几乎是在沉默中度过的，我们知道一切尽在不言中。\n列车来了，挤满了乘客。这是我见过最拥挤的纽约地铁了，没想到是在最后一程遇见了。人很多，他说“快挤，待会儿挤不上了”。我和他握了握手，抓着行李箱就上了地铁。列车开动时，我看到他从窗户外给我打招呼，我也向他告别。\n当时我似乎没有任何热烈的情感，没有任何的怀念与惋惜，只是平平淡淡地，就像车平平淡淡地开走了一样。但我知道，君子之交淡如水，这份友谊会长存。\n## 城市的感觉\n我喜欢这座城市，远超我的期待。城市生活节奏很快，很压抑，人人都是快速行走，不想给自己找麻烦，朋友家公寓的电梯让我坐出了跳楼机的感觉，快快快，时间就是金钱。但我是游客，一个特立独行的存在，慢与快的碰撞，让我有机会观察每一个纽约客，每一节地铁车厢里的百态众生，第五大道上人们的笑容和面孔。我爱四处张望，尽可能多的去感受这座城市。\n帝国大厦之巅，我见证了真正的世界城的繁华。大都会博物馆的玻璃展厅，我见识了美国历史文化的强大和世界文明之国的霸道。911纪念馆，我感受到了城市脆弱的一面，铭记历史的心。\n这里其实更像中国的城市，相似的生活方式。\n有机会，还来。与她一起。","completion":"NYC, friends, travel"}
{"prompt":"The End of My Freshman Year: Standing at the myrtle beach today, I began to reflect on my Freshman journey.\nI feel very blessed and fortuated enough to have what I have seen, experienced, and learned from this school year. I never thought my first year in college would be as good as it went through. I was questioning about fate and believed everything is in my control if I worked hard enough. It is just not the truth after experiencing and contemplating on all the things that happened to me.\nI am grateful for my fate. I only had in total a month of online school classes since the covid began. When the virus hitting US, I had come back to normal school mood back in China. As now the virus explodes in China, I have come to US for studying. I still hate Zoom and cannot imagine how my friends went through even all-year-long online courses. I feel like everything in my life is finely presetted so I could have the best outcome as possible. In this sense, I believe myself as a special person as I am certainly being blessed by someone or something that I do not think others have in the same way as I have.\nI am grateful for people around me. I know I have already said this over and over again, but I do genuienly feel this way. Opporuntities, happinesses and thoughts I have, those are all brought by someone else than me. I have met so many talented, passionate, unique and interesting people at Duke that makes me feel previliged to talk to them. I woudld like to list them all but I could not since the list would be super long. It is amazing that how many people have helped me and together shaped me into the person I am today.\nLooking back at the entire school year, there are also countless highlight moments for me. A random dinner with friends, a road-trip, a makenew Friday, whatsoever... But it never is how I grinded out an exam or what is my quiz score on certain tests. I believe, at least for me, grades is the least important thing among all those important things. As long as I have no regrets to myself, I do not think I should put more time on grades. But also, classes are more important than grades as I always tried to do an interesting but harder question rather than easy but boring one. I did that on my phiolosophy final and I felt so good about it that I do not care about the grade anymore as I have spoken what I would like to say and to learn what I want to learn.\nThe life is full of adventures ahead waiting for me. Life is fantastic and just best of the best. I kind of understand why 生命 and 生活 are both life in English—因为我像爱生命一样爱我的生活，爱生活一样爱着我的生命。","completion":"Myrtle Beach, summer, gratitude"}
