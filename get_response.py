The story opens with the narrator taking on a lodger in his apartment, an old soldier named Astafy Ivanovich. One day, a thief steals the narrator's coat, and Astafy tries to pursue him unsuccessfully. Astafy is dismayed by the theft and goes over the scenario over and over again. The narrator and Astafy share a distinct contempt for thieves, and one night Astafy tells the narrator a story of an honest thief that he had once run across.
One night in a pub, Astafy Ivanovich happened upon Emelyan Ilyitch. The two knew each other on beforehand, but now Emelyan was obviously poor from the look of his tattered coat. He was aching for a drink but had not the money. Astafy was moved by Emelyan's acutely pathetic position, and he bought him a drink. From then on, Emelyan followed Astafy everywhere, eventually moving into his apartment. Astafy did not have much money himself, but he allowed Emelyan's imposition because he was very aware that his drinking was a terrible problem. Emelyan would not stop his drinking, however, and even though he was quiet and not disruptive when he was drunk, Astafy could see that Emelyan would never be able to support himself with such a habit. Astafy urged him to quit drinking, but to no avail. Eventually, Astafy effectively gave up on him and moved, never expecting to see Emelyan again.
Very soon after Astafy had moved Emelyan appears at his new apartment, and the two continue to go on as they had before. Astafy would support Emelyan with food and lodging, and Emelyan would always go out and come back drunk. Sometimes he would disappear for days only to return drunk and almost frozen.
Astafy, now working as a tailor, was short on money. One of his projects, a pair of riding breeches for a wealthy customer, were never claimed. He thought he could sell the breeches to get money for more useful clothes and some food, but when he decided to sell the breeches, they were nowhere to be found. Emelyan was drunk as usual, and denied the theft. Astafy was terribly vexed by the theft, and kept looking for the breeches while still suspicious of Emelyan. Emelyan always denied the theft.
One day, Astafy and Emelyan had a terrible fight over the breeches and Emelyan's drinking, and Emelyan left the apartment and did not return for days. Astafy even went to look for him one day with no luck. Eventually, after a couple of days, Emelyan returned, almost starved and frozen. Astafy took him back in, but it was clear that Emelyan's days were numbered. Days later, after Emelyan's health had deteriorated terribly, Emelyan wanted to tell Astafy something about the breeches. With his last words, Emelyan admitted to stealing the breeches.",
"Our fantastic bridge -- Bridgination: **So, it’s time to prepare for the final exam and enjoy the only moment we have in fundation period. In addition, it’s time for me to do some review.**
## One of the colorful activities
May is the month of all kinds of colorful activities in my school. I participated in the bridge building competition which I was really reluctant to at first.

[it's our bridge: ""Bridgination"", the name is given by myself！](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/bea775ably1g495p7s5bkj23402c0npd.jpg)
## Hard and harsh
It was really a hard and harsh time for me to build a beautiful and strong bridge because I had no idea about any stuff about the bridge. What’s more, I have a team that I didn’t appreciate previously. Maybe I just wanted to do it with the mentality of playing.
What kind of bridge, how to build the pillar, how to connect all the parts united? I didn’t know how to deal with these massive problems. We just went forward step by step, mistake by mistake.
My teammate, Skywing (a frightening name right?), who is talented in building arches for the bridge, tried to make tons of archs used for his bow and arrow instead of being a part of our bridge. I didnot know how to persuade him at all. But luckily, he finally finshed the arch customed only for our bridge.
## Presentation
Maybe it’s a pretty sucessful presentation? I don’t know. However, it’s my first time to stand in the face of all the students from fundation class. I weared a suit because I think it’s a very formal occasion to show my respect. I was told I only had 5 minutes to present which truly makes me nervous and anxious.
At the moment standing on the stage, I saw the expecting eyes from the audience clearly. Speaking aloud with the gesture of my hand, it’s the only thing I remember. Everything including additional preparation was all forgotten behind my head.
When I finished, I heard applause one after another. I was excited and proud of my teammates and myself.

## Result
We won the **Design Award** and **Aesthetic Award** finally. It really surprised my teammates and me.
## Something I learn from it
### Team spirit
We are like a loose sand at first but after the hone, we all have grown up in several aspects. I am very thankful to my teammates Skywing, Wooken and Sydeny.
### Making some friends
During the process, I was helped by many people including my classmates who was not in our team, the students from other class, the foreign teacher, the physics teacher…
